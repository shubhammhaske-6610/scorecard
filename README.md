## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

Our vision for the Scorecard project includes several enhancements to make it even more powerful and user-friendly:

*   **💾 Data Persistence:** Implement saving and loading of student data to/from a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) to avoid re-entering data.
*   **📊 Advanced Analytics:** Add features for calculating median, mode, standard deviation, and grade distribution.
*   **🚀 Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Develop a simple GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for a more visual experience.
*   **🧪 Robust Input Validation:** Enhance error handling for non-numeric inputs and invalid data.
*   **🌐 Web Interface:** Explore the possibility of a lightweight web-based version for collaborative use.

### Branching Conventions

*   All new features or bug fixes should be developed in a dedicated branch.
*   Use a descriptive branch name, such as `feature/add-data-persistence` or `bugfix/fix-average-calculation`.
*   Do not commit directly to the `main` branch.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes.
4.  **Make your changes** and commit them with clear, concise messages.
5.  **Push** your branch to your forked repository.
6.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the original repository.
7.  Provide a clear description of your changes and why they are necessary.

### Testing Requirements

*   For any new features, please add relevant test cases to ensure functionality.
*   Ensure existing features continue to work as expected after your changes.
*   Currently, manual testing is sufficient, but unit tests will be appreciated for complex logic.
